# 2019-Garden
An 8-bit binary flower generator in Turbo BASIC XL for Atari 8-bit. Entry for 2019 10-line BASIC contest

A quickie, final entry for the 2019 10-liner BASIC contest: GARDEN.

Inspired by [arjanvandermeij’s](https://twitter.com/arjanvandermeij) [#plottertwitter](https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23plottertwitter&src=typd) art [“8 bits binary flowers,”](https://twitter.com/arjanvandermeij/status/1108485237296762880) I wanted to create something similar on the Atari 8-bit. I recently learned how to draw ellipses in my work on Renderiffic, my SVG renderer for Atari 8-bit computers, and learned how to rotate shapes from Bruce Artwick’s book [Microcomputer Displays, Graphics and Animation.](https://amzn.to/3cxZe6V) It was easy to combine the two techniques to draw a garden of elliptical flowers.

The program is just a little screensaver that endlessly draws and erases flowers. It’s not a game, so qualifies for the WILD category of the 10-line contest. It’s only four, 120-character lines in Turbo-BASIC XL. Once I get my 1020 plotter back from the fixit guy, I’ll make a version that draws these shapes on paper.
